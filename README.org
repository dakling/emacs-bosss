* Description
This package is intended to provide an alternative interface to [[https://github.com/FDYdarmstadt/BoSSS][BoSSS]].
For an example configuration, please refer to my emacs config in my dotfiles-repository

* Installation
Since this package is probably only interesting for a limited group of people, 
inclusion into ELPA or MELPA is currently not planned. If you would like me to 
package it there, please let me know.

For the time being, simply clone this repository and add require the file bosss.el.

* Configuration
Example (using use-package and general for key bindings):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(use-package bosss
  :ensure t
  :init
  (setq bosss-pad-path "/home/yourname/BoSSS/src/L4-application/BoSSSpad/bin/Debug/BoSSSpad.exe") ;; path to BoSSSpad.exe
  (setq bosss-path-reference "/home/yourname/BoSSS-experimental/internal/src/private-kli/RANS_Solver/bin/Debug/RANS_Solver.exe") ;; optional: add a reference path to your project executable
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.bws\\'" . bosss-mode)) ;; link bosss-mode to .bws file type
